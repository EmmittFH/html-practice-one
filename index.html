    <h1>This is a level one heading.</h1>
    <p>There are a total of six level headings. One being the largest in text size and six being the smallest in text
        size.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Paragraph</h2>
        <p>The reason you are able to read the text in this sentence. It is because of the paragraph tags. There are
            opening
            and closing tags. With the opening and closing tags and the content, an element is formed. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Anchor</h2>
        <p>If you want to the anatomy of an HTML element. MDN has a great explanation of what an <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics"
                target="_blank">HTML
                element</a> is and how it works.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Div</h2>
        <p>This paragraph element is inside of div tags. The div is a container tag to group things together. Divs can
            help to organize the content in your HTML.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Span</h2>
        <p>This is another div tag that contains a paragraph element. You cannot see this. But the letters of
            <span>MDN</span> are in span tags. You can see them if you inspect the HTML code. The span tag does not do
            much unless it is utilized with CSS or
            JavaScript.
            That is all I can type about span for now, I am still learning more about tags.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>There are lists that can be created in HTML. There is an ordered list and an unordered list. An ordered list
            utilizes numbers. This can be used for steps in a sequential order. An unordered list utilizes bullet
            points.
            This can be used for a grocery list of items to buy.</p>
        <p>This is an ordered list example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wake up</li>
            <li>Brush teeth</li>
            <li>Shower</li>
            <li>Eat Breakfast</li>
            <li>Go to work</li>
            <li>Take nap after work</li>
            <li>Go for a walk</li>
            <li>Shower after walk</li>
            <li>Eat dinner</li>
            <li>Learn to code</li>
            <li>Get ready for bed and rest</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This is an example of an unordered lists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get an oil change for the car</li>
            <li>Go to Target</li>
            <li>Drive to the movies and watch a movie</li>
            <li>Buy a Braves baseball cap</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ordered lists and unordered lists can be used together:</p>

        <h2>Button</h2>
        <p>You will see a button. It will be useless. In order for the button to work, you will need JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>Img</h2>
        <p>Img is short for image. Images can be displayed in your HTML code. You should us an alt text to your image.
            The alt text is an attribute. The alt text helps to tell users what the image is.</p>
